Project 1: Humans VS Goblins

Project Description:

The "Humans VS Goblins" game is an engaging turn-based strategy game where players control characters represented as objects, including land, goblins, and humans. This Java project aims to implement a grid-based game world using UTF characters to visually represent players and goblins. The game features turn-based movement (n/s/e/w), and combat is initiated when a human and goblin collide, utilizing random math for combat outcomes.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Design: Represent game entities (land, goblins, humans) as objects. Override the toString method for each object to provide meaningful representations.

Grid-based Game World: Create a grid to serve as the game world. Utilize UTF characters to visually represent players, goblins, and land.

Turn-Based Movement: Implement turn-based movement for players (n/s/e/w) within the grid.

Combat Mechanism: Initiate combat when a human and goblin collide. Use random math for combat outcomes.

Extras:

Inventory System: Implement an inventory system for humans.

Drops for Goblins: Define drops for goblins after combat.

Stats Modification by Equipment: Allow equipment to modify the stats of characters.

Random Treasure Chests: Generate random treasure chests on the map after each round of combat.

Goblin Pursuit: Implement goblins that actively pursue players.

Project Goals:

Create a complete Java application that simulates the Humans VS Goblins game.
Implement grid-based movement, combat, and character interaction.
Demonstrate effective use of object-oriented programming principles.
Incorporate optional enhancements to add depth and complexity to the game.
Skills Developed:

Object-oriented programming in Java.
Grid-based game design.
Turn-based strategy game mechanics.
Random number generation for combat outcomes.
